    <div> This exercise is about making lists </div>
    <br>
    <div>Here's what I like about lists:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <div>When you make a list, do it in this order:</div>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <div>For this exercise:</div>
    <br>
    <div>I want you to Google image search your full name and place the first result here:</div>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS8QhM0Mz9l06DMRD2i-SJ6RqdjCwnnJoqvQKOKk11VDRF8GIj1&usqp=CAU" alt="photo of me" width="200px">
    <p>Use the "width" attribute to make the image 200 pixels wide</p>
    <br>
    <p>This exercise is simple</p> 
    <p>Just link to any website on the internet and make the link text "Click me"</p> <a href="https://google.com">Click Me</a></div>
    <br>
    <p>This is the last exercise</p>
