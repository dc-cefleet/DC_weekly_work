<!-- Write a function 3x that has two parameters and those parameters are used in a 
sentence that says "hello my name is NAME I am AGE years old", 
except NAME and AGE would be the parameters given.

    Use the 3 ways of declaring a function to make each function different but the results to console the same.
    For each function use a different way of creating the output sentence. For example only one can use concatanation.

Write a function that has another function as a parameter, and inside the main function the parameter function is 
called after you print to the console "Main Function Executing".
    You can declare the function as a varaible before and place that variable as the parameter.
    (Challange) have the main function have a second parameter that will be used as an argument for the child function.

Write a function that will print to the console "Parent Function Called" and then returns a function that when is called will 
print to the console "Child Function Called" The child function cannot be declared outside of the main function. Follow steps bellow if you need a step by step way to do it.
    Create a function and have that function print to the console.
    Inside the main function declare the second function as a variable that prints to the console the given statement
    after the second function is declared inside the main function, return the variable that the second function is assigned to.
    Outside of the function assign the called function to a variable (that variable is now a function).
    call that variable. -->
